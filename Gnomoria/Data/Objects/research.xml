        ResearchID: Defines ID of research referenced everywhere else
        SkillID: ID of skill associate with progressing this research
        BaseDifficulty: Base difficulty of research
        PerLevelDifficulty: Per level difficulty of research
        
        Difficulty is in units of seconds (but is modified by skill when researching)
        Each level of difficulty uses the formula BaseDifficulty + CurrentResearchLevel * PerLevelDifficulty
        Using a base of 10 and a per level of 5, to research level 1 it would be 10, level 2 15, level 3 20, etc.  Each level takes slightly longer to research than the previous
