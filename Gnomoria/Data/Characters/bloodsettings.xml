  <!--WeightedBigBloodSpriteID: Sprite that is randomly picked when a character is bleeding profusely.  Supports an arbitrary number of sequential WeightedBigBloodSpriteIDs
        Weight: Affects liklihood of this sprite being randomly chosen.  ex Two sprites with equal weight (1 and 1) both have 50% chance. A weight of 3 is 3x as likely to be chosen vs 1 (75% vs 25%)
        Sprites: Sprite to be rendered
          SpriteID (Needs to be renamed to avoid confusion): Supports an arbitrary number of these, rendering in order with the last one on top
            SpriteID: Actual ID of sprite to be rendered
